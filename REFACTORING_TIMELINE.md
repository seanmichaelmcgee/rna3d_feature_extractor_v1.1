## 4. Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| ViennaRNA compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test ViennaRNA integration early, prepare fallback options |
| Memory optimization challenges | Medium | High | Implement incremental memory improvements, set conservative limits |
| Feature compatibility issues | High | Low | Maintain rigorous validation, ensure backward compatibility |
| Timeline delays | Medium | Medium | Prioritize core functionality, have clear MVP definition |
| Container portability issues | Medium | Medium | Test on multiple platforms early, use standard container features |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

The refactoring project will be considered complete when:

1. **Functionality**: All features from the original notebook are implemented
2. **Performance**: Memory usage is optimized for large RNA sequences
3. **Compatibility**: Output features are compatible with downstream models
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite passes with >90% coverage
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples
6. **Containerization**: Container works on both local and Kaggle environments

## 6. Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using GitHub issues and milestones:

1. Create issues for each component implementation
2. Use milestones for each phase
3. Track progress with weekly status updates
4. Use pull requests for code review
5. Document lessons learned and challenges

## 7. Implementation Priorities

In case of time constraints, the following priorities should be followed:

1. **Must Have**:
   - Core feature extraction functionality
   - Memory optimization for single-sequence MSAs
   - Basic containerization
   - Essential documentation

2. **Should Have**:
   - Comprehensive memory monitoring
   - Batch processing optimization
   - Advanced validation
   - Enhanced containerization

3. **Nice to Have**:
   - Advanced visualization
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Extended documentation
   - Additional optimizations

## 8. Repository Transfer Strategy

After completing the refactoring, the codebase will be prepared for transfer to a new repository:

1. **Final State Preparation**:
   - Ensure all components are fully implemented and tested
   - Verify comprehensive documentation is complete
   - Confirm all tests pass with good coverage
   - Clean up any temporary or unneeded files

2. **Repository Readiness**:
   - The completed codebase will be in a state ready for an "initial commit" to any new repository
   - All components will have clear Git history showing the refactoring progression
   - Directory structure and package organization will be production-ready
   - The codebase can be immediately cloned and used from the new repository

3. **Transfer Process**:
   - The recipient will need to provide a new remote repository URL
   - The refactored codebase can be transferred with standard Git commands:
     ```
     git remote add new-origin <new-repository-url>
     git push -u new-origin main
     ```
   - Alternatively, the codebase can be cloned and pushed as a fresh history if desired

## 9. Post-Implementation Support

After completing the refactoring:

1. Provide 1 week of dedicated support for issue resolution
2. Create detailed knowledge transfer documentation
3. Establish monitoring for potential memory issues
4. Plan for quarterly review of performance
5. Set up automated testing for ongoing validation
