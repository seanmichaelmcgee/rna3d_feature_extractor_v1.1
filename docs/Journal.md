# Testing Journal

This document tracks the progress of testing the RNA feature extraction pipeline according to the execution plan in TestingPlan.md.

## Execution Plan Progress

### 1. Environment Setup (10 minutes)
- [x] Activate mamba environment
- [x] Verify ViennaRNA installation
- [x] Check directory structure

### 2. Single Target Testing (20 minutes)
- [ ] Select one well-understood target
- [ ] Run through all three notebooks with LIMIT=1
- [ ] Validate all output files and naming patterns
- [ ] Check feature consistency and quality

### 3. CLI Script Testing (20 minutes)
- [ ] Test each script with a single target
- [ ] Verify outputs match notebook-generated files
- [ ] Test batch processing with 3-5 targets

### 4. Small Batch Testing (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run notebooks with LIMIT=5
- [ ] Verify feature consistency across all targets
- [ ] Check cross-validation metrics
- [ ] Test with validation and test data

### 5. Edge Case Testing (20 minutes)
- [ ] Test with problematic inputs
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Check log messages and fallback mechanisms

### 6. Complete Run (optional, time dependent)
- [ ] Run full datasets if time permits
- [ ] Check resource usage and performance

### 7. Documentation and Reporting (20 minutes)
- [ ] Document any issues found
- [ ] Create summary statistics for feature quality
- [ ] Generate reference visualizations of key features

## Detailed Testing Notes

### Step 1: Environment Setup
**Completed on:** April 10, 2025

**Environment Activation:**
- Successfully initialized mamba shell with: `eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"`
- Activated rna3d-core environment: `mamba activate rna3d-core`
- Verified ViennaRNA version: 2.6.4 (matches environment.yml specification)

**Next Steps:**
- Check the directory structure to ensure all required paths exist âœ“ DONE

**Directory Structure:**
- Created required directories: data/processed/{thermo_features,dihedral_features,mi_features}
- Verified raw data directory contains necessary MSA files
- Verified existence of train, validation, and test files
