# Implementation Plan: Single-Sequence MSA Optimization

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for optimizing the mutual information calculation for single-sequence MSAs. The optimization aims to detect and handle cases where an MSA contains only one unique sequence, avoiding unnecessary calculations and improving performance.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### 2.1 Update `mutual_information.py`
- Add early detection of single-sequence MSAs
- Implement zero-matrix generation for single-sequence case
- Add metadata flag for single-sequence cases
- Ensure API compatibility with existing features

### 2.2 Update `enhanced_mi.py`
- Add early detection of single-sequence MSAs
- Implement zero-matrix generation for single-sequence case
- Ensure consistency with basic MI implementation
- Add metadata flag for single-sequence cases

### 2.3 Testing
- Unit testing with single-sequence MSAs
- Integration testing with feature extraction workflows
- Performance benchmarking with various sequence lengths

### 2.4 Documentation
- Update function documentation
- Add implementation notes to code comments

## 3. Timeline

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Documentation | Create technical study and implementation plan | ‚úÖ Completed |
| MI Function Update | Update `mutual_information.py` | üîÑ In Progress |
| Enhanced MI Update | Update `enhanced_mi.py` | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Testing | Unit and integration testing | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Finalization | Documentation updates and validation | ‚è≥ Not Started |

## 4. Validation Approach

The optimization will be validated by:
1. Verifying output structure compatibility
2. Comparing performance metrics before and after
3. Testing with real-world single-sequence MSAs

## 5. Reversion Plan

In case of any issues, revert to the commit created with this documentation (before implementation began).
