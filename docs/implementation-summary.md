# RNA 3D Feature Extractor Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the three critical components needed to prepare our RNA feature extraction pipeline for Kaggle submission:

## 1. Feature Verification System

We've created a comprehensive verification script to ensure our extracted features are compatible with the PyTorch data loader requirements:

- **Path**: `scripts/verify_feature_compatibility.py`
- **Main Functions**:
  - Verifies directory structure (dihedral_features, thermo_features, mi_features)
  - Checks file naming conventions match expected patterns
  - Validates feature arrays have correct names and dimensions
  - Simulates loading with the data loader to verify compatibility

The verification script can run on all targets or a specific target ID with detailed reporting. It's designed to identify compatibility issues quickly before Kaggle submission.

## 2. Memory Monitoring System

We've implemented a robust memory monitoring system to track resource usage and identify bottlenecks:

- **Path**: `src/analysis/memory_monitor.py`
- **Features**:
  - Function `log_memory_usage()` for measuring memory at specific points
  - Context manager `MemoryTracker` for tracking code sections
  - Function decorator for monitoring function calls
  - Visualization of memory usage over time
  - Profiling for different RNA sequence lengths to estimate Kaggle requirements

The memory monitoring system has been integrated into all feature extraction functions in the notebooks, allowing us to track memory usage across the entire pipeline.

## 3. Single Target Testing System

We've created a comprehensive testing system for single target verification:

- **Path**: `scripts/single_target_test.py`
- **Features**:
  - Complete end-to-end processing of a single target
  - Extracts all three feature types (thermodynamic, dihedral, MI)
  - Includes memory tracking throughout the process
  - Validates feature compatibility with the data loader
  - Option to compare with Docker environment for consistency

Additionally, we created a Docker comparison tool to ensure consistency between environments:

- **Path**: `scripts/compare_docker_outputs.py`
- **Features**:
  - Compares features between local and Docker environments
  - Checks file existence, key matches, and content similarity
  - Detailed reporting of any differences found

## How to Use These Tools

### Feature Verification

```bash
# Verify all features
python scripts/verify_feature_compatibility.py ./data/processed

# Verify a specific target with detailed output
python scripts/verify_feature_compatibility.py ./data/processed --target R1107 --verbose
```

### Single Target Testing

```bash
# Process a single target and validate features
python scripts/single_target_test.py --target R1107

# Process and compare with Docker environment
python scripts/single_target_test.py --target R1107 --docker
```

### Memory Profiling in Notebooks

The notebooks have been updated to include memory monitoring. Key additions:

1. Import memory monitoring utilities:
```python
from src.analysis.memory_monitor import MemoryTracker, log_memory_usage, plot_memory_usage
```

2. Log memory at critical points:
```python
log_memory_usage("Before feature extraction")
```

3. Track memory during intense operations:
```python
with MemoryTracker("Feature calculation"):
    features = extract_features(sequence)
```

4. Profile different sequence lengths:
```python
profile_results = profile_memory_for_lengths(lengths=[100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000])
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run full testing**: Process a representative sample dataset using these tools to identify and address any issues
2. **Resource optimization**: Use memory profiling to optimize the pipeline for Kaggle's constraints
3. **Feature format standardization**: Ensure all features follow the naming conventions verified by our tools
4. **Docker environment validation**: Verify consistency between local and Docker environments for reliable results
