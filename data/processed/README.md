# Processed Data Directory

This directory contains the generated feature files from RNA feature extraction:

- `thermo_features/` - Thermodynamic features from RNA sequences
- `dihedral_features/` - Pseudodihedral angle features from 3D coordinates
- `mi_features/` - Mutual Information features from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)

These directories are automatically populated when running the feature extraction notebooks or scripts.
